# Project 25 - Todo App (OOP Project)

This is Javascript Todo App built using object oriented programming paradigm and ES6 Classes. Tasks can be added, removed, changed or marked as completed. The App stores all the receives data in the local storage and whenever revisiting the page renders exactly in the same condition as it was left.

Responsive for all screen sizes.

**This is my 25th project so far.**
